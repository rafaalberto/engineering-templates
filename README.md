# 🧰 Engineering Templates

A collection of reusable templates, configurations, and best-practice tooling for backend and platform engineering.  
This repository centralizes CI workflows, documentation templates, code quality standards, and security configurations that can be applied across multiple projects.

These templates are the exact setups I use across my Java/Kotlin backend projects, enabling consistency, faster project setup, and professional-grade repository standards.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **personal engineering toolkit**, providing:

- Reusable GitHub Actions workflows (CI/CD)
- Branch protection rule examples
- Documentation templates (README, PR, Issues, ADR)
- Security & compliance configurations
- Code quality standards for Java/Kotlin projects
- Docker & development environment templates

This makes it easy to bootstrap new repositories quickly while keeping them aligned with modern engineering best practices.
